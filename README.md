# Paraphrase Generation
Codebase for CMPUT 651 final project.

Final file for running the model is:â€Œ [`./cgmh_ae/CGMH/paraphrase/paraphrase.py`](./cgmh_ae/CGMH/paraphrase/paraphrase.py)


This project aims to work on phrase-based sentence paraphrasing. 
For this goal we build on the previous endeavors in the two projects mentioned below:

1)Constrained Sentence Generation via Metropolis-Hastings Sampling 
 https://github.com/NingMiao/CGMH
 
 2)Stochastic Wasserstein Autoencoder for Probabilistic Sentence Generation
